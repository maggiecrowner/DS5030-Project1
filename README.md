## Data Acquisition
The data file was sourced from the ACLED and can be accessed at the following link: https://acleddata.com/monitor/ukraine-conflict-monitor
The file 'ukraine_markov' contains the final version of the project. The file 'ukraine_exploration' was used exclusively to get a sense of the data and should be ignored for the final grading process.
